# WebViewFullscreen-demo-MacOS
A simple webview app to test video player fullscreen bugs.


* To recreate the issue with this app, simply choose a video and fullscreen it, then pause it. the video player should vanish. Exit fullscreen, then try to fullscreen the video again, in which the entire app view should vanish.

* SOLVED: The issue was fixed, however I still filed a bug report with Apple, as this shouldnt be expected behavior here.
